# Estimate-Tool
Hello! A housekeeping services business had the problem of spending a lot of money and time going to go perform an estimate. For example, a potential client requests an estimate but then they go out and do not get the sale because the price the consumer is willing to pay does not meet their cost of performing the service. I thought to myself, "there has to be a better way." I spoke with the owner, who explained to me the way she calculates cost and did my best to replicate that via computing logic.

Now instead of spending money on vehicle maintenance, gas, their hourly wages, this tool saves them thousands every year and is a great sales tool to agree on a range before committing to going out in-person or scheduling right then and there.

P.S Please ignore the weird file adds and version control I manually did. I am new to git and this was my first repository in which I pushed/pulled/committed and updated the files. I have since stopped doing this weird manual stuff and use my terminal now and commits for version control.
